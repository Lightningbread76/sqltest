              What I can bring to the table is a deep understanding in Object Oriented Programming,HTML/CSS,  javascript, typescript, MongoDB and Firebase. 
              I also have experience in python, R, and the agile development workflow from my past internships and courses at Boston University."

              One of my strengths is having the ability to recognize who is best at doing what while working in a team environment and I often use that intuition to maximize efficiency and productivity."
